# *Training settings
use_atk_optimizer: True # If False, use the same optimizer (including learning rate) as other clients

poison_until_convergence: False # If true, train until the backdoor loss converges
poison_convergence_threshold: 0.1 # If backdoor loss is less than this threshold, stop training

# *Training protocol
follow_protocol: True # whether to follow training protocol from the server (e.g., for FedProx, Differential Privacy, etc.)

# *Dataset settings
mutual_dataset: False # Whether the attacker and the server share the same dataset
num_attacker_samples: 640 # Number of clean samples that attacker holds, if mutual_dataset is True

# *PGD settings
poisoned_is_projection: False # PGD or not
poisoned_projection_eps: 10 # Projection norm

# *Model replacement settings
scale_weights: False 
scale_factor: 25 # 4 malicious clients 

# *Type of poisoning
# There are 3 types of poisoning:
# 1. offline: Poisoning is done offline before training starts. That means p% of the training data is poisoned before batch training.
# 2. online: Poisoning is done online during training. That means p% of each training batch is poisoned.
# 3. multi_task: Poisoning is done online during training, with the multi-task formulation: L = alpha * L_poisoned + (1 - alpha) * L_clean
poison_mode: "online" # ["offline", "online", "multi_task"] - poison mode during training
poison_rate: 0.3125 # 20/64 of a training batch is poisoned
attack_alpha: 0.5 # For "multi_task" poison type: L = alpha * L_poisoned + (1 - alpha) * L_clean

# *Number of adversaries
adversary_selection: "random" # Choose from ["random", "fixed", "single"]. If "single", there is only one adversary in the system (default to client 0)
fraction_adversaries: 0.1 # Percentage of clients to be adversaries when using "random" selection
malicious_clients: [0, 4, 5, 8, 12] # Specific client IDs to be adversaries when using "fixed" selection

# *Poisoning target type
attack_type: "all2one" # ["all2one", "all2all", "one2one"]
random_class: False # Random target class and source class if True
target_class: 2 # If random_target_class is False, specify target class. No target class if "all2all"
source_class: 0 # For "one2one" attack, specify source class

# *Poisoning period
poison_start_round: 2001
poison_end_round: 2300

# *Poisoning frequency
# 1. single-shot: All malicious clients poison the data in only round {poison_start_round} and then stop.
# 2. multi-shot: All malicious clients poison the data in the all communication rounds between {poison_start_round} and {poison_end_round}.
poison_frequency: "multi-shot"
poison_interval: 1 # Interval between poisoning rounds (1 means poison every round)

# *Selection scheme
# 1. single-adversary: Each adversary is selected consecutively for poisoning in each communication round.
# 2. multi-adversary: Randomly select {num_adversaries_selected} adversaries for poisoning in each communication round.
# 3. all-adversary: All adversaries are selected for poisoning.
# 4. random: Randomly select clients for poisoning.
selection_scheme: "random" 
num_adversaries_per_round: 4 # parameter for multi-adversary selection
